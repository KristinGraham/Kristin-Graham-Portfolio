    <h2> About Me </h2>
    <p>After 15 years in the Film and Television industry, I have decided to take the producing, planning, and problem-solving skills I developed and transfer them to a new field where I dont need millions of dollars to create something that I am proud of. </p>
    <p>When I'm not creating Websites, Apps & Games...</p>
    <ul>
      <li> I still enjoy Filmmaking. </li>
      <li> I am a runner. I believe running long distances has taught me how to push through physical and mental challenges to accomplish goals.</li>
  <p> My background has helped me develop a great work ethic and a strong ability to communicate and work well with others.</p>
